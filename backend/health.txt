=== Trifocus Q&A Knowledge Base ===

[Platform Basics]
Q: What makes Trifocus different from Headspace/Calm?
A: We combine 3 unique elements:
1. Token rewards for PROVEN habits (via eye-tracking)
2. Your data stays OWNED by you (IPFS + encryption)
3. AI that adapts to your mood in real-time

[Accountability System]
Q: How does staking work?
A: 
1. Lock tokens when starting a habit (e.g., 10 tokens for 7-day meditation)
2. Complete sessions with biometric verification
3. Earn tokens + bonuses if successful, lose stake if you quit

Q: Can I fake meditation sessions?
A: Impossible - we use:
- Real-time eye-tracking (camera checks closed eyes)
- Voice stress analysis for journaling
- Device-only processing (no cheating via screenshots)

[Privacy]
Q: Where is my meditation/journal data stored?
A: 
- Biometrics: Never leaves your device
- Journals: Encrypted on IPFS (you hold decryption keys)
- Blockchain: Only stores proof hashes, not content

[Therapist Access]
Q: How do therapist sessions work?
A: 
1. Earn tokens through habits
2. Browse KYC-verified therapists
3. Pay directly with tokens (smart contract holds payment until session completes)

[Crisis Support]
Q: What if the AI detects I'm in danger?
A: 
1. Immediate crisis resources shown
2. OPTIONAL emergency contact alert (you pre-set this)
3. Anonymous helpline routing available
