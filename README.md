## 📌 Problem Statement  
Most mental health apps lack accountability and verifiability. Users often abandon self-care habits due to lack of motivation or reward. Additionally, there's no biometric verification of habits like meditation. Web2 platforms also don't prioritize user-controlled data sharing or anonymity in high-risk cases.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To create a full-stack mental health Web3 platform where:

- Users commit to wellness habits via token staking  
- Meditation is verified via **eye-tracked camera detection**  
- AI provides personalized tasks, emotion analysis, and crisis detection  
- Token rewards are earned upon verified habit completion  
- Sessions with therapists are booked using earned tokens  
- All sensitive data is **user-owned** and securely shared  

**Track:** 🧠 AI + Web3 Wellness  
**Users:** Wellness seekers, therapists, and decentralized health advocates

## 💪 2. Habit-Staking  

- Users **stake tokens** to commit to daily wellness routines
